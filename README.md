My first attempt at creating a sample landing page for a website. All information is template, but it functions as a good exercise to see how I perform coding an actual landing page. 

I used html and css. When I ran into problems, like trying to figure out how to get rounded corners on buttons and boxes, I used Google to find the solution. 

Overall, I am proud of how the project turned out, and I believe I have a strong foundation of html and css knowledge at this point!
